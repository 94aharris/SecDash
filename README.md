Realtime Enhanced Security Dashboard (RESD)

Background:  This dashboard is the front end for a security analytics aggregation and analysis tool which I am working on. The backend of the tool utilizes Flume, Kafka, Solr, and Hadoop technologies in order to receive, process, tag and find trends within logs pulled from security tools. In addition, this dashboard will be used in order to subscribe to different security feeds. This dashboard is to provide security analysts with an overview of the health of all sites, as well as the ability to drill down into the specific health of a singular site.

Work / To-Do:   Obviously this project is still in the begining stages. This repository only shows the front end dashboard, I am simultaneously working the backend systems in order to get it so that data can be feed into the dashbord. Currently, the dashboard will remain static HTML5 and Bootstrap for simplicity; however, future use of AJAX to make the dashboard more 'APP' like will be investigated.
